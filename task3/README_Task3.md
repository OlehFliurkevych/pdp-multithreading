1.	Implement asynchronous message bus. Do not use queue implementations from java.util.concurrent.
2.	Implement producer, which will generate and post randomly messages to the queue.
3.	Implement consumer, which will consume messages on specific topic and log to the console message payload.
4.	(Optional) Application should create several consumers and producers that run in parallel.
